# HelpHive: the Flutter version

## Project Description
This is my Flutter project, which I created as part of my bachelor's thesis on the topic of "Comparative Analysis of Modern Cross-Platform Frameworks: Insights into Flutter, React Native, and Ionic." It is a simple application based on volunteering to offer mutual assistance. The app features a user management system implemented with Firebase.
Users can request, edit, view, and delete help. Volunteers have the opportunity to view and accept tasks, and then contact the person in need.

## Requirements
To run the project, the following tools must be installed:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Flutter and Dart extensions for VS Code (you can install it directly in vs Code)
